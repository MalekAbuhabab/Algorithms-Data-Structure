# Algorithms-Data-Structure
Exercises to learn Algorithms &amp; Data Structure

## The concept of algorithms and data structures
First, focus a little on understanding the difference between Algorithms and Data Structures in terms of the way they are given in universities and institutes.

Algorithms learn from them how to think and analyze while writing the code until you reach the result that you want to get, so this is the entrance to programming.
Data structures in general are how they combine algorithms with OOP concepts such as Class, Object, Inheritance, etc.

The most important point you need to know is that algorithms and data structures are just principles you adopt when writing the code.
That is, you do not think that the algorithms themselves are a programming language, or that the data structures themselves are a programming language.
You will understand what we mean more when you find that each exercise in the course has a solution in it with more than one programming language, but the logic adopted in the solution is almost the same, whatever the programming language is used.

## Am I ready for this course?

If you have previously studied algorithms and have also studied at least one programming language such as Java, Python, C ++, C # etc. .. you are ready to start this course because all the algorithms and principles of object programming you will have already learned and learned.
If you do not know anything of what we have mentioned then you must learn at least one programming language to start this course

## How important are algorithms and data structures?
The main objective of this course is to develop yourself in programming analysis to the maximum extent possible.
For this reason, this subject is considered one of the most important and difficult subjects that students learn in institutes and universities.

Also, when applying for a job in any government institution or in any programming company, you will find in the challenge that you perform special exercises about algorithms and data structures because they will be able to know the extent of your ability to analyze and solve programming problems, and this is what the programming companies need most.

## Who is this reference for?

This reference is intended to fit all people who want to develop their software capabilities.
So whether you are an amateur, a student or a programmer, this reference will help you to develop your ability to analyze and reach a very advanced level.
