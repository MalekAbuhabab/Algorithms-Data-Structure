# The concept of algorithms and data structures
First, focus a little on understanding the difference between Algorithms and Data Structures in terms of the way they are given in universities and institutes.

Algorithms learn from them how to think and analyze while writing the code until you reach the result that you want to get, so this is the entrance to programming.
Data structures in general are how they combine algorithms with OOP concepts such as Class, Object, Inheritance, etc.
